BUGS
Done - Islands: on collision with black hole or other islands, no destruction taking place - Jingyi
- Tonemapping: color flickering (either fix, or ->disable<- tonemapping for now) - Wer Zeit hat
//- Player: sometimes gets stuck while walking, for no (apparent) reason, jetpacking out helps
//- Enemies: sometimes don't get hit? (seems so, at least)
//- Enemies: getting stuck at each other, trees, or sometimes player(?)
//- Enemies: task.vertexBuffer == NULL error?! (seems to be a character animation bug in the newest release of Unity though, so maybe ignore for now)

IMPROVEMENTS
- Enemies: replace sendmessage("method") calls on enemy scripts by getcomponent().method() calls (and store getcomponent() result where feasible) - should be a lot more efficient - Thorsten, Jingyi
- Enemies: only spawn them within certain radius/distance of/to player: not spawn when too near to player already ("fake too obvious", unfair to spawn right behind player's back), not spawn when too far away to have any influence, only spawn them on a middle distance (likely that player visits soon) - Thorsten, Jingyi
- Enemies: despawn/respawn or set inactive/active based on distance: if player leaves, enemies don't need to do stuff and consume CPU resources - Thorsten, Jingyi
DONE - Enemies/Collectibles: make loot drop down / hover tied to islands (either parenting or rigidbodies) - Wer Zeit hat
DONE - WorldGeneration/Islands: synchronize island falling speed with distance to black hole as well as remaining time and/or increase falling speed near time 0 - Jingyi
- GrapplingHook: on rope shortening, use lower limit for maximum moveposition-pull per frame (to avoid clipping through stuff), if necessary spread (lerp) larger pull over several frames or use limited move-pull together with a force - FloR/W
DONE - Player: slight "air control" / influencing of jumping and falling direction for better/smoother feeling during playing - FloR/W
- Weapons: make projectiles a bit more noticeable/visible - Wer Zeit hat
DONE - Weapons: no shooting while game is paused or bastion menu is open - FloW
DONE - neither shoot nor show regular gui when paused or bastion - FloW
DONE - Player: heal up inside bastion! - FloW
//- Camera: remove jittering
//- Weapons: add small knockback to visualize impact

//POLISHING
- Enemies: Textures!
- Bullet holes: fade instead of shrink, maybe?
- Audio: play some basic background music (jingyi mentioned free music from friend in the past; or pick up some other free-to-use music)
- Audio: some basic sound cues (sounds for shooting, projectile hit/impact, enemy death, enemy attacks, (enemy idle - useful for noticing flying enemies), player-getting-hit, jump/land, (better footsteps), grappling hook, jetpack, collect stuff, buy upgrade, island collapse)
- Effects: some basic particle effects (island collapse, hit/death)
