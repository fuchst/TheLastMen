1 Person: Plays videogames regularily

Procedure: Person plays game for 10 minutes without any explanation, afterwards missing information is given, player plays 5 min with knowledge about full controls/mechanics etc., then player fills in survey

Notes from Observing:

Procedure in game after first startup:
- instructions were found independently
- starts exploring inside bastion, shoots boxes
- tests out all buttons inside bastion, then goes outside
- can not find home after some jetpacking around
- uses hook to grappel to island, uses mouse wheel to get to island, does not use swing mechanic
- trys to collect wood by shooting trees (wood icon in inventory and HUD suggested this)

Stuff suggested during play:
- sounds for attacking enemies. Especially flying ones as they attack from angles not visible
- Game needs to explain what aim is, especially explain artefact mechanic, explain that jetpack uses energy and chrystals replenish, explain hook swinging
- artefact islands hard to find
- artefacts of different kinds should look different



(More suggestions were put into survey text fields)
